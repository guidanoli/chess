Chess
=====

Implement a chess game interface that is sufficiently generic
to adapt to any possible representation and interaction with
the game and its players.

There must be first a command line implementation and then
a graphical implementation whose controls aren't dependable
on the command line but in the graphical display window and
interactions (mouse and keyboard).

This projects is to be divided into the following stages:

- Describe in formal ways a chess game
- Implement a generic chess game interface
- Implement a command line chess game
- Implement a chess game with GUI
